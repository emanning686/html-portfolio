<h3>Surfs Up</h3>
<p>All time classic. What's there to hate about surfing penguens. The documentary style is easily my favorite aspect.</p>
<h3>Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties</h3>
<p>I mean, come on. Two Garfields! This funky cat puts a smile on my face every time.</p>
<h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
<p>The big iron guy has feelings, love to see it</p>
